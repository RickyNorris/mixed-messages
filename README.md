# Mixed Messages - Whats for dinner

## Discription 

In the CodeCademy Full-Stack programming course we are making a javacript program that will return a randomized mixed message with the words of my choosing, the program will help with one of the worst questions you could ever ask your partner, what do you want for dinner? Oh No, if you have ever had that question and just said i dont care, you need this program!!!!

## How to use the project

When the code is run with a javascript jext editor it will return the random message that can then be logged in the console, i will at a later date try and make it into an interactive website to make it easier to use.

### Credits 

This project was created by a **VERY** junior full stack developer during my learning process.
