# Mixed Messages Gay 

## Discription 

In the CodeCademy Full-Stack programming course we are making a javacript program that will return a randomized mixed message with the words of my choosing, the program will return a cohesive but short sentance that should make sence when read.

## How to use the project

When the code is run with a javascript jext editor it will return the random message that can then be logged in the console, i will at a later date try and make it into an interactive website to make it easier to use.

### Credits 

This project was created by a **VERY** junior full stack developer during my learning process.
